== Description ==

Simple File List is an ultra-basic file list with optional front-side uploader. The plugin provides an easy-to-integrate basic user interface allowing visitors, clients, customers, or associates to upload a file as well see a listing of those files (separate from the media library) if you choose.

What's New in Two?

* Added multi-file uploading option
* Added optional front-side user input form
* Added configurable upload directory option
* Added File List sorting options
* Improved HTML display and design
* Improved email notifications
* Added ability to send notifications to more than one address

The list and/or the uploader can be turned on and off for the front-side of the website. You can show just the list, just the uploader, or both. In the administration area there is a page which always shows both. Additionally, you can set up the basic file upload settings, such as size and allowed types, plus easily delete files as needed.

This plugin is great for when file sizes get too large for email attachments, if you simply need a list of files separate from the media library, or if you need a down-and-dirty simple front-side uploader.

Simple File List is also an alternative to using FTP or Dropbox for larger files. There's no need to deal with Dropbox or FTP usernames and passwords anymore! Everything is on your Wordpress website.
